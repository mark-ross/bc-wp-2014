   could be a GIF) filled with a colour (I chose orange because it
   contrasts pleasingly with blue - opposite on colour wheel) and then
   every other pixel is filled with another colour (e.g. white) which is
   made the transparent colour (ordinary transparency) - anything behind
   the transparent pixels shows through and our wonderful brain fills in
   the rest, thanks to Gestalt psychology.  Only really works when a solid
   colour is required, such as table row rollovers. NOTE: IE doesn't like
